How to run my code:
    python3 movieDB.py tmdb_5000_movies.csv

    It doesn't matter if you are just trying to run each individual query you must always specify the file name as above.
    It's just how I set it up.

My code assumes the database is called 'a5' the createSchema function should create it, but just incase.
All the query function will first USE a5 and assume the data is already present.

All of the query function are by default commented out. You may uncomment them to have them run.
